# Owners

remote-es is maintained by a group of people, who should be at least three members of the remote-es GitHub organization.

Owners have the following responsibilities:

* Review issues and pull requests, providing answers, feedback, and incorporating changes into the repository.
* Otherwise keep the repository useful.
  This means that the information in the repository should be useful, reasonably correct, and available to everyone.
  This includes making a reasonable effort to prevent the repository from infringing any law or regulation (for example, respecting GitHub guidelines so the repository is not banned, and thus ceases to be useful because it is not available), and ensuring no person or group is excluded from using the repository or is harmed from it.

Owners can also engage as any other person with the repository:

* Keep an eye on offers they see, and add them to the repository like a regular contributor.
* Propose improvements to the repository.

And ultimately, the owners have the final say in any matter regarding the repository, including deciding on the owners of the repository.
Owners should make a reasonable (for volunteer work) effort to participate in repository maintenance.

In an attempt to make the governance of the repository as effective and inclusive as possible, diversity should influence owner selection.
Owners should try to increase the diversity of the owners, so as many different possible perspectives are considered when taking any decision.
