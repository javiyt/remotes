# Adding new companies

I validate the following:

- [ ] The company listed hires in Spain, without requiring employees to become freelancers/self-employed/aut√≥nomos
      The company hires with a legal entity in Spain, uses an employer of record, or other means.
- [ ] The company offers fully remote positions, where the employee must not visit an office regularly and can work from anywhere in Spain.
      Some occasional travel is OK.

- [ ] The URL provided shows a list of positions at any time.

- [ ] I have tagged the offer adequately with:

* (All offers are remote) **if the job listing does not offer any indication that all offers are remote, nor marks clearly remote offers**, but all jobs are remote.
* (All technical offers are remote) **if the job listing does not offer any indication that all offers are remote, nor marks clearly remote offers**, but all technical offers are remote.
* (View individual job offers to check for remote) **if the job listing does not offer any indication that all offers are remote, nor marks clearly remote offers**, so you need to check individual offers to see if the position is remote.

We will only merge PRs with the checkboxes marked, and where the poster adds a small text explaining how they know (a simple explanation like "I work there", "I applied there and they validated this to me", or "a friend works there and says this is correct".
